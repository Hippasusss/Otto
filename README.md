## Overview
This plugin emulates the classic Moog MF-101 analog low-pass ladder filter with and envelope follower. It has:

- 2 or 4-pole (12 or 24 dB/octave) resonant low-pass (Ladder) filtering
- Envelope-controlled cutoff frequency modulation
- Drive control for analog saturation (with optional oversampling)
